      <h2>Fursona Lore</h2>
      <p>
        Umbre, my sona, grew up relatively normal, or at least as normal as you can get when growing up with feline companions and canines alike. 
        Growing up in the lower Middle Class always led to a mix of species in the neighborhood, and as a consequence there was always some sort of conflict happening.
        Whether it be a fight or bullying incidents to even murder, the place could never be quiet.
